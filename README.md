# Darkbot Zombie
Darkbot Zombie is a plugin for [Darkbot](https://github.com/darkbot-reloaded/DarkBot)
automating PVP kills for missions. It allows for a bot to
be sent to a specific location to be destroyed by the main
player. The main player can also be using the same bot with
automatic attacking for that player.
